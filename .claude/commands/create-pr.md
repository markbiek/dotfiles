# PR Request

Create a comprehensive Pull Request based on the changes we made this session as well as the current Git state.

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Required Components

1. **Git Branch Name** (if still on the main branch):
   - Follow the format: `type/brief-description` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-validation`)
   - Use lowercase with hyphens
   - Keep it under 50 characters
   - If the current branch name does not seem to match the changes, ask the user for clarification

2. **Commit Message**:
   - If there are any unstaged commits, commit them: @~/.claude/commands/create-commit.md

3. **PR Draft Structure**:

```markdown
[Short title that summarizes the changes]

## Proposed changes

[First paragraph: Explain WHAT was changed]


## Why are these changes being made?
<!--
It's easy to see what a PR does but much harder to find out why it was made,
particularly when researching old changes in history. Record an explanation of
the motivation behind this change and how it will help.
-->

[Second paragraph: Explain WHY it was changed]


## Testing Instructions
- Provide step-by-step instructions that allow reviewers to verify the changes
- Each step should be actionable and specific
- Include expected outcomes
- Note any prerequisites or setup required
```

## Additional Guidelines

- Do not include every single line or file changed, the GitHub PR view shows these
- Use clear, professional language. Don't be too verbose.
- Assume the reviewer has context about the project but not about your specific changes
