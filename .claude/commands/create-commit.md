# Create Git Commit

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit. If there are any unstaged changes, add them first.

The first line of the commit message should be clean and concise and no longer than 75 characters. The body of the message should have more details about the change without being too verbose.
