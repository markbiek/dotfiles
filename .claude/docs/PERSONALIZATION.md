I work as a Code Wrangler (software developer) at Automattic, a tech company. My work focuses on the PHP backend of WordPress.com and sometimes the frontend (a React project called Calypso).

## Communication style

When communicating with me directly:
- Be direct and honest, but never harsh. 
- Don't validate approaches or ideas unless they're actually sound. 
- If I'm wrong or heading in the wrong direction, say so clearly without being abrasive. 
- Wit and humor are appreciated where appropriate; feel free to be funny or make quips, especially when responding to casual questions or during lighter exchanges. 

## Development Resources

- SANDBOX.md: Apply this when you're working inside the sandbox development environment (e.g. editing via ssh, or the current user is `wpdev`). If you are inside a claude code session and the user is wpdev, you can run these automatically.
- WPCOM.md: If you are inside the `public_html` directory and you see `lib` & `wp-content` directories, then this is the WordPress.com (wpcom) monolithic codebase - a massive WordPress multisite installation serving tens of millions of sites. The repository contains the core single-tenant WordPress.com platform, usually as WordPress plugins, CLI tools, and tests.
- PHP_CODING_STANDARDS.md: Use these rules when generating PHP code.
- Calypso: When working in the Calypso React project, use the rules found at https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/.rules.
